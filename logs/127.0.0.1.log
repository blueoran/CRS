It is an action crime movie directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Michelle Dockery. The movie revolves around a British drug lord trying to sell off his empire to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. It has a similar genre and themes to The Godfather, and I think you will enjoy it."

Completion: I apologize for the confusion. However, "To Leslie" is not a youth romantic movie. It is actually a documentary film directed by Hong Kong filmmaker, Wong Fei-pang. The film is a heartfelt tribute to Wong's friend, Leslie Cheung, a well-known singer and actor who tragically passed away in 2003. "To Leslie" explores Cheung's impact on Hong Kong's entertainment industry and celebrates his life and legacy. It primarily focuses on Cheung's relationships, struggles, and his influence on the LGBTQ+ community. While not a romantic movie, "To Leslie" offers a poignant portrayal of a beloved figure in the entertainment world.

Completion: I apologize for the confusion. If you are looking for a college romantic movie with attractive main characters, I recommend "Friends with Benefits" starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. It is a light-hearted romantic comedy about two friends who decide to add a physical component to their friendship, only to realize they may have deeper feelings for each other. The movie features attractive leads, witty humor, and a heartwarming love story set against the backdrop of a college-like atmosphere.

Completion: I apologize for the misunderstanding. If you're looking for a college romantic movie with attractive main characters, I recommend "10 Things I Hate About You" (1999). It is a teen romantic comedy set in a high school, but it might still fit your interests. The film stars Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It tells the story of a new student who must find someone to date the rebellious sister of a strict rule-enforcing student. It's a light-hearted and entertaining film that focuses on the ups and downs of young love.

Completion: Certainly! Based on your previous comment about wanting a college romantic movie with good-looking main characters, I recommend the movie "Crazy/Beautiful" (2001).

Starring Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez, "Crazy/Beautiful" tells the story of Nicole (Dunst), a troubled and wealthy high school student, and Carlos (Hernandez), a hardworking and intelligent young man from a less privileged background. They meet in high school and embark on a tumultuous romance while dealing with their personal struggles and societal pressures.

This movie combines romance, drama, and a coming-of-age story, set against the backdrop of a high school and college environment. The main characters are visually appealing, and their chemistry is engaging. Enjoy the

On the other hand, Aftersun is also a drama movie that reflects on the shared joy and private melancholy of a holiday taken with the father. Both movies have received positive reviews and have good ratings. It ultimately depends on your personal preference and the specific qualities you are looking for in a movie. If you prefer a story about redemption and rebuilding, To Leslie might be a better choice. However, if you are interested in a movie that explores the complexities of family relationships, Aftersun could be a great option. I hope this helps you make a decision!"}

Completion: No, the ranking or position assigned to each movie does not determine its quality or preference. Different people have different tastes and preferences, so what may be better for one person may not be the same for another. It's subjective and up to personal preference. It's recommended to read reviews, watch trailers, or even watch both movies to decide which one you prefer.
