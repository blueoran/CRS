It is an action crime movie directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Michelle Dockery. The movie revolves around a British drug lord trying to sell off his empire to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. It has a similar genre and themes to The Godfather, and I think you will enjoy it."
