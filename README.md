## Usage

under `CRS` directory:

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

> Note: Type `Ctrl+Z` to suspend the process then kill it mannuanly if it stuck during the process instead of `Ctrl+C`, as the Error Handling part has not been perfectly implemented yet.

## TODO

- A better product retrieval method
- More structured code for further development (more functionalities and attributes)
- Role-Goal-Task based dialogue management
- Error Handling
